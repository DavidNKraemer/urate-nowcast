# urate-nowcast
A little project for experimenting with calibrating a nowcast of the national unemployment rate.

I have Federal Reserve unemployment rate data saved in the `data` directory, and a script which calibrates a simple ARIMA model on the data in `scripts`. It generates a plot and saves it in the `figures` directory.

# TODOs

* Incorporate Google search data
* Switch to using BLS unemployment data
* Build a more sophisticated model
* I'm sure there are other things to do
